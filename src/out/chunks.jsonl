Evaluating Loss Exposures- In this step information is gathered about an applicant's loss exposures.Underwriters must understand the activities, operations, and character of every applicant.However, tradeoffs are necessary to control underwriting expenses and to handle a reasonable number of applications.Underwriters weigh the need for information against the cost to obtain it.For example, an underwriter is likely to thoroughly investigate a manufacturing facility whose raw material is petroleum products.Not quite so much information is needed for a retail facility in the local strip mall.2.) Determining underwriting alternatives- Each alternative is carefully evaluated.The underwriter must choose the optimal one under the applicable circumstances.The three underwriting alternatives are:\n• Accept the submission as is.\n• Reject the submission.\n• Make a counteroffer to accept the submission subject to certain modifications.", "content_sha1": "3475e165bc38fcc74a12a6f73ac8f2c5aa61f229", "metadata": {"filename": "CA_UPCI4.txt", "ext": ".txt"}}

Require loss control measures to reduce hazards- Some loss control measures are relatively inexpensive and simple to implement, while others, such as fire sprinklers, require considerable capital investment.\nb.) Change insurance rates, rating plans, or policy limits- A submission that is not acceptable at standard rates might be desirable if the underwriter can charge a different rate, use a different rating plan, or provide a different limit.A rate modification could either increase or decrease the premium.Smokers will not get the best life insurance rates while a preferred risk program might be presented to a desirable applicant who applies for coverage at standard rates.\nc.) Amend policy terms and conditions- A submission might become acceptable by modifying the policy to exclude certain causes of loss, add or increase a deductible, or make another coverage change.\nd.) Use facultative reinsurance- If the applicant is in a class of business that is not covered by the underwriter's reinsurance treaty, or if the amount of insurance needed exceeds net treaty capacity, the underwriter might be able to transfer a portion of the liability for the applicant's loss exposure to a facultative reinsurer.3.) Selecting an underwriting alternative- The underwriter must decide whether to accept the submission as offered, accept it with modifications, or reject it.Rejection is sometimes unavoidable; however, rejections produce neither premium nor commission, only expense.Therefore, underwriters try to make the submission acceptable because one of the insurer's goals is to produce profitable business.4.) Determining the appropriate premium- Underwriters must ensure that each loss exposure is properly classified so that it is properly rated.Insurance loss costs are typically based on an elaborate classification system in which similar loss exposures are combined into the same rating classification.Combining loss exposures into rating classifications enables the insurer to appropriately match potential loss costs with an applicant's particular loss exposures.Consequently, the insurer can develop an adequate premium to pay losses and operating expenses and to produce a profit.Accurate classification ensures a pooling of loss exposures whose expected loss frequency and loss severity are similar.", "content_sha1": "41e93c952884001680cd1b51b073ae995ed09128", "metadata": {"filename": "CA_UPCI4.txt", "ext": ".txt"}}

Implementing the underwriting decision- Implementing underwriting decisions generally involves three steps:\na.) Contact the producer (and others involved) with the decision, good or bad.If the decision is to accept the submission with modifications, the reasons must be clearly communicated to the producer or applicant, and the applicant must agree to accept or implement the modifications.If the application is rejected, a clear and logical reason why the particular applicant does not meet the insurer's underwriting requirements must be communicated.\nb.) Put coverage into effect.Issue a binder, send a policy worksheet to the policy unit, or prepare certificates of insurance.\nc.) Record the policy and the applicant information for accounting, statistical, and monitoring purposes.Data entry personnel enter essential information into the insurer's information system.It must be coded so that the insurer and the industry can evaluate and accumulate information on all accounts for ratemaking, statutory filing, and financial accounting.6.) Monitoring the loss exposures- After an underwriting decision has been made on a new business submission or a renewal; the underwriter must monitor activity on the individual policies to ensure that satisfactory results are achieved.Historical Development of Underwriting\nThe word \"underwriter\" stems from the manner in which the first contracts for insurance were written.Most experts agree that the first insurance contracts were property insurance covering sailing vessels and their contents.The typical maritime insurance contract insured against several perils-such as fire and storms-which could cause the ship's owner to lose the ship or its contents.These contracts also stipulated the amount that the owner would receive from the insurer as compensation in the event of such a loss.The first insurers were individuals who agreed to assume someone else's risk for a mutually agreed upon price.These individuals endorsed the contract under the signature of the party purchasing the insurance coverage and thus became known as \"underwriters:' Life insurance underwriting also originated in connection with maritime insurance, when insurance coverage was purchased to cover the lives of merchants and captains traveling on insured ships.", "content_sha1": "b950396f557a3ff4dd43200d7920929cee8ea074", "metadata": {"filename": "CA_UPCI4.txt", "ext": ".txt"}}

(The latter was used before the development of the current distinction between \"ineligible,\" meaning a risk which cannot be written under the company's filings, and \"unacceptable,\" meaning a risk which the underwriter cannot find a way to write even though it is eligible.", "content_sha1": "e4443264d3000500164a28e0aefa17e5e3eedb97", "metadata": {"filename": "CA_UPCI4.txt", "ext": ".txt"}}
